# Team 411 HashCodeChallenge: The Pizza Makers

This repo will contain all the data files and code for solutions to the Hashcode Challenge problem 
by Google. 

Only Team 411 members should make pull requests to this repo; any others who so desire can fork this repo.


# Convention
Let's have separate directories for each language we choose to
make a solution.

# Preliminary Solution

This is an optimization problem as optimization problems typically require to maximize or minimize something. The main details are fairly well hidden in the problem statement (this is quite good). The solution will use either dynamic programming, or the greedy strategy. An immediate data structure that comes to mind is a Stack, but a Queue can also possibly be used. As the data sets grow larger and larger, different data structures should be used. A Hash table data structure comes to mind as well.

- Related optimization problems from CLRS:
- - Rod Cutting
- - Matrix Chain Multiplication
- - A combination of matric chain multiplication and rod cutting might also be used to formulate a solution.


# Final Solution will be in Java

Language of choice does not matter, however.
